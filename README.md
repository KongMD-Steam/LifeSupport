# Life Support
Life Support is a mod that adds the 'Life Support System' building. It's a linkable to Medical Beds that will prevent a pawn from dying if they lose organs.  I took this building from the mod 'Questionable Ethics' and made it a standalone mod to increase mod compatibility.

## Building the Life Support System
1. Research Hospital Beds & Medicine Production
2. Research the Life Support System in the 'QEE' tab (QEE stands for Questionable Ethics Enhanced)
3. Build it from the 'Misc' Architect tab

## How the Life Support Hediff works
In the current implementation, any number of organs can be removed, with the exception of the brain, without the pawn dying. However, if a pawn missing an internal organ loses connection to the Life Support System or is removed from the bed, they will die instantly. Only conditions that would kill the pawn in the vanilla game will cause them to die, upon removal from Life Support.

How you utilize this machine is up to you; you can use it to ruthlessly harvest the organs of hapless victims, or use it as a temporary stopgap before getting a replacement organ. Perhaps you'll use it for both of those purposes!

## Can I use this on an existing save?
Yes.
