	<description>Life Support is a mod that adds the 'Life Support System' building. It's a linkable to beds that will prevent a pawn from dying if they lose organs. I took this building from the mod 'Questionable Ethics' and made it a standalone mod to increase mod compatibility.

See the mod description page on Steam for more information.
